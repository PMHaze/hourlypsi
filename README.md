# Hourly PSI by DataKind with pm.haze

This is a project to visualize the hourly PSI based on NEA's data.
On the datakind branch, this is written in R; on the legacy branch
it is written in JavaScript.

We will be trying to update both branches in parallel. Any and all
help is appreciated. All our code will use the Apache 2.0 license,
so you are free to take this for commercial purposes if you really
want to.
